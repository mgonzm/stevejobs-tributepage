            Steve Jobs co-founded Apple Computers with Steve Wozniak. Under Jobs' guidance, the company pioneered a series of
            revolutionary technologies, including the iPhone and iPad.

        <h2>Founding of Apple</h2>
        <p>Jobs was raised by adoptive parents in Cupertino, California, located in what is now known as Silicon Valley. Though he
        was interested in engineering, his passions of youth varied. He dropped out of Reed College, in Portland, Oregon, took a
        job at Atari Corporation as a video game designer in early 1974.
        Back in Silicon Valley in the autumn of 1974, Jobs reconnected with Stephen Wozniak, a former high school friend who was
        working for the Hewlett-Packard Company. When Wozniak told Jobs of his progress in designing his own computer logic
        board, Jobs suggested that they go into business together, which they did after Hewlett-Packard formally turned down
        Wozniak’s design in 1976. The Apple I, as they called the logic board, was built in the Jobses’ family garage with money
        they obtained by selling Jobs’s Volkswagen minibus and Wozniak’s programmable calculator.</p>

        <h2 class="second-title">Insanely Great</h2>
        <p class="second">During that same period, Jobs was heading the most important project in the company’s history. In 1979 he led a small
        group of Apple engineers to a technology demonstration at the Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) to
        see how the graphical user interface could make computers easier to use and more efficient. Soon afterward, Jobs left
        the engineering team that was designing Lisa, a business computer, to head a smaller group building a lower-cost
        computer. Both computers were redesigned to exploit and refine the PARC ideas, but Jobs was explicit in favouring the
        Macintosh, or Mac, as the new computer became known. Jobs coddled his engineers and referred to them as artists, but his
        style was uncompromising; at one point he demanded a redesign of an internal circuit board simply because he considered
        it unattractive. He would later be renowned for his insistence that the Macintosh be not merely great but “insanely
        great.” In January 1984 Jobs himself introduced the Macintosh in a brilliantly choreographed demonstration that was the
        centrepiece of an extraordinary publicity campaign.</p>
